Automated cross conversion of saber sound font naming conventions between popular controller boards:  
Proffieboard, CFX, Golden Harvest 3, Verso, and Xenopixel 3.    
No need to manually rename a font (or many fonts) so it can be used on a different platform. Just click and done.  

Automatically converts audio files if the source is not in optimal 44.1kHz, 16 bit, monaural PCM WAV file format.  
Proffie to Proffie conversions organize and rename a ProffieOS sound font for the best performance when used on FAT32 formatted media.  
The Optimize checkbox is also on by default for other boards to Proffie conversions, but can be turned off. (but why?)  

Usage: Super easy. Barely an inconvenience.  

- Choose a source and target sound board format.  
- Choose a font folder from your local computer.  
- Click the Convert button.  
- Click the Download button to retrieve a zip file containing the newly named font files.
