Automated cross conversion of saber sound font naming conventions between 4 popular controller boards:  
Proffieboard, CFX, Golden Harvest 3, and Xenopixel 3.  
Includes a "Proffie Easy Optimizer" button to organize and name a ProffieOS sound font for the best performance when used on FAT32 formatted media (which is what the SD card is).  
No need to manually rename a font (or many fonts) so it can be used on a different platform.
Just click and done.

Usage:  Super easy. Barely an inconvenience.
 - Choose a source and target sound board format.  
 - Choose a font folder from your local computer.  
 - Click the Convert button
 - Click the Download button to retrieve a zip file containing the newly named font files.
 
 Donations are appreciated ;)
